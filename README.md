# PORTFOLIO

This is the first project of our program. I like to show this old version of my portfolio, not to show my current abilities but it serves as a good display of how far I've come!

I followed a basic landing page structure:
-   Welcome Message
-   Navbar
-   About Me / Tech Skills
-   Projects
-   Contact
-   Footer

## Languages and Tools
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- SASS
- Formspree
- Github
- Jira

## Design
In terms of design, I tried keep a modern and clean site. Using a font from Google Fonts and a custom color palette.

## Issues, things to improve and Challenges to be done by the end of the program
 
- My navbar should display a "hamburguer" button so that I can select different links. (Bug to be fixed)
- Popup may have more information about the project and tools used.
- Recreate this site using React and a no-code platform (WebFlow)
- Store each project in a database collection (firebase) and fetch data.

# About the Project
## Outline

It is time to put what you have been learning to the test here is your project brief!
Your challenge is to put everything you’ve learned so far to the test by building your own portfolio website. This website will form the foundation of your final portfolio at the end of the course, allowing you to showcase yourself and your work to its best potential. You are obviously free to iterate on the design of it as you progress through the course, but the aim for now is a high quality first draft that we can connect all your future projects to.
Let’s build!
We’re aiming for the following goals for this project:

### A working Portfolio:

The main task is to create a portfolio to showcase what you will be learning on the course and to give the visitors an insight to who you are.

### Practice using Git and GitHub flow:

We want you to get as much practice as possible using git, GitHub and the command line.

### Apply what you are learning:

This is a great place to apply what you have been learning on the course. Push on, use SCSS, BEM, anything else you find on the web.

## MVP

-   You need to have it as a public repository on GitHub
-   In the repo you will also need a README.md with a short intro to the project.
-   You are to use SCSS for styling.
-   You are to use B.E.M as a naming convention.
-   !!! Responsiveness is vital – use Grid, Flex, whatever you wish but the site must look good at all screen widths.
    VERY CRITICAL! : You will need to make sure that your website looks good on phones, tablets and laptops (we will see Media Queries next week, docs to follow)

Your Portfolio should have the following section:

-   A landing page/section with your name and title on it.
-   An About page/section with a little bit about you
-   A Tech stacks/skills page/section with all the techs you have learned during the course
-   A Project page/section with all your projects (use placeholder images and text at the beginning to render your website as it would with actual projects) - each project should have a little description, a link to a live version and a link to the matching GitHub Repo (using a README.md at the root of the repo to include how you went about coding for that project)
-   A Contact page/section with your email, GitHub profile link, LinkedIn profile link

### TIPS:

-   Choose a clear, clean, simple colour palette
-   Make sure to have the MVP done with all the different section before adding extra feature (animations, effects, etc)
-   Create a new branch for each section of your page to practice your Git
